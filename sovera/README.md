## Dev Deployment

- [ ] **TODO:** write detailed dev documentation. This is too terse for devs without DevOps experience. 

   

1. Update .env with required `keys` and `endpoints`
2. From root of the project run `make dev_setup`  ðŸ™Œ  don't worry if you see a :shit: ton of errors. 
3. Bring the cluster down `make down`
4. Bring up dev_cluster `make cluster`



:eyes: at `Makefile` in project root for additional commands including DB migrations 

:tipping_hand_man: depending on the version of docker you many need to modify `Makefile` for docker compose to work. **Notice** the removal of hyphen in docker compose command

If your system has Docker Compose V2 installed instead of V1, use `docker compose` instead of `docker-compose`. Check if this is the case by running `$ docker compose version`. 

Example: 

```makefile
-LOAD_FIXTURE = docker-compose exec -T web ./manage.py loaddata
+LOAD_FIXTURE = docker compose exec -T web ./manage.py loaddata
```
